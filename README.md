# CONSECUTE
CONSECUTE is a challenge in which you have to progress on a project for the running time of a playlist, the only stops being for food and toilet. The minimum runtime of the playlist is 20h. You MUST END the challenge with the song "Malaysia airlines' complaint" by Feldup, available here: https://feldup.bandcamp.com/track/malaysia-airlines-complaint

"Malaysia airlines' complaint" does NOT count towards the 20h, unless it is also played earlier in the setlist. The music must be continuous. If you do not like a song, you may not skip it. You may mute it, but you may not skip it, even if you are the one who made the playlist.

For approval, you must not only record the entire performance, you must also PR/make an issue with a link to both the video of said performance and the setlist/playlist you have used. It is discouraged to use shuffle mode.
